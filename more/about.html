 					<h2>Pamela Sarfo</h2>
 					<h3>CEO</h3>
 					<p style="text-align: justify; margin: 50px;">Just something important about this person
 					I write to you in the behalf of Emmanuel Owusu-Larbi, one of the most industrious and diligent Electrical Engineering students I have ever taught and supervised in my years spent as an Electrical Laboratory technician at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and I can state for a fact that he would make a prolific candidate for your Master of Science in Information Technology - Network and Telecommunications Management program
					In the Four years of every Electrical and Electronics Engineering Undergraduate, each student is expected to undertake several practical lessons at the Laboratory to give them understanding in the practical world. Emmanuel is undoubtedly one of the most intuitive and hands on undergrads Iâ€™ve come across.  He was always attentive and assumed leadership role within his group. He would always take responsibility for errors which may or may not necessarily have been his fault. Emmanuel usually would spend time at the Labs trying to understand certain principles of operations of machines which he found very abstract especially those of relation to Transformers, electrical drives and motors.  This approach and system of belief makes him a very good student. Yes, he had his flaws in academic performance but he was always willing to work hard to rectify his errors and not giving up on himself, persevering and staying focused to achieve his goal is an admirable and very commendable attribute of a student I would gladly recommend for your Institution to enable him achieve his dreams.
					It delights me that Emmanuel considered me for recommendation and with this opportunity to guide him on a right career path; I will always look forward to his consistent progress over the years to come. I am very aware of his choice of program and I append my approval as a sign of recommendation for your prestigious Institution to enable him further his education. Please do not hesitate to contact me via the email provided.
					Best Regards
